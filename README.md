CODE 1161 Data Project

Notes:

- figuring out how pandas and notes work
- originaly copying Bens and figuring it out
- getting data in took a while
- tried to plot but realised needed to heavily trim and clean data
- once cleaned plots were easier
- researched annotating and types of plots
- imported different plotting tools

I found this entire project extremely fun and rewarding. The freedom of the entire porject definitly played a role in its enjoyment but it was a mixture of learning a new tool as well as deep diving into a subject which greatly interests me. Once I got the hang of it, I found pandas to be a very powerful tool. I oiginaly had my doubts but it proved me wrong. As with everything this c ourse has taught me, there was a week or so of not undersatnding what anything meant and then a kind of click in my brain and I figured out what each line was achieving. The most difficult part for me to figure out was the twin AX plotting, other than that, with enough resarching and trial and error, the plot making was wasn't too bad once I had a narrative idea, and again, seeing results was very rewarding. The hardest part would be the data cleaning and reshaping to be used properly. Even to the end of the project that aspect of Pandas and notebook still confuses me as there's so much to need to know in order to propely reshape a data set. However, as said at the start, this was a very rewarding and entertaining project and I would definitly be using Pandas again, (and obviously Python).
